# [HorseApp - Equine Management](https://github.com/joseag312/portfolio-spring-app)

üêé **A full-featured CRUD application for veterinarians and horse owners, built with Spring Boot**

A full-featured CRUD web application that streamlines equine care and client management.  
Built with Spring Boot, Spring Security, PostgreSQL, and Swagger.

Veterinarians can:

- Manage clients and their horses
- Browse each horse‚Äôs treatment history
- List products and services
- Handle client billing

Users can:

- Assign a veterinarian to their horses
- Browse consultation history
- Transfer horses (along with their full medical history) to another user

**Designed as a portfolio piece to showcase software engineering best practices.**

## Portfolio Focus

This project was designed as a **demonstration of software engineering practices** applied to back-end development.

### SOLID

- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Controllers, services, and repositories handle only one layer of responsibility.
- **Open/Closed Principle**: New endpoints and entities can be added without modifying existing logic.
- **Liskov Substitution Principle**: DTOs and entities can be swapped in the service logic if they follow the same contract.
- **Interface Segregation Principle**: Repository interfaces expose only the necessary persistence operations.
- **Dependency Inversion Principle**: Controllers depend on service abstractions, not repositories.

### Security & Authorization

- **Spring Security Integration**: Configuration in two classes `SecurityConfig` and `MethodSecurityConfig`.
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Fine-grained access based on roles done with `@PreAuthorize` and an `AccessGuard`.
- **Authentication Flow**: Implemented `AuthenticationService` and `AuthorizationService`.

### Data Persistence

- **Normalized PostgreSQL** Schemas with sequences for unique IDs.
- **Strong constraints**: Unique keys, composite PKs, and cascading FKs for integrity.
- **Targeted indexing** Lookup & join columns indexed for performance.
- **Clear naming conventions** Scripts design for repeatable setups and DB recreation.

### Spring Framework

- **Layered Architecture**: Controllers ‚Üí Services ‚Üí Repositories.
- **Data JPA**: Repositories abstract persistence.
- **Spring Security**: Centralized configuration and role-based access via `@PreAuthorize`.
- **Dependency Injection**: Services and components wired through Spring‚Äôs IoC container.
- **DTO Mapping**: Request/response models decouple API contracts from entities.

### API Documentation

- **Interactive API Docs**: Integrated Swagger/OpenAPI UI.
- **Auto-Generated Contracts**: Controllers annotated for proper documentation.
- **Developer Experience**: Demonstrates API-first design for other developers.
